.Sh PLUGINS
.Ss promoter
The promoter plugin monitors events on resources an executes systemd units.
This plugin can be used for simple high-availability.
.Ss umh
The user mode helper is a plugin that allows users to specify filters matched
on DRBD state changes (e.g., from
.Sy Secondary
to
.Sy Primary
). If a filter rule matches, a user defined script gets
executed and various useful environment variables get set.
.Ss debugger
This is a simple plugin that prints change events to stderr. This is mainly
useful as a simple showcase for users or plugin writers. It also helps
developers to detect bugs in drbdd's core.
.Em Important:
Messages are printed on debug level, so make sure to set an apropriate log
level.
